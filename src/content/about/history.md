Our owner, Juan Ponce, a man from humble beginnings, comes from a small town in Mexico where success is only a faint dream. In 1989, Juan embarked on a risky journey that would relocate his family (wife and kids) to Maryland with very little money. Filled with determination, he began working labor-intensive jobs from washing dishes to pouring concrete. After several years of persevering through the rigors of starting over, in 1996, Priority Construction Corporation was born. Juan's vision was a company predicated on productive work relationships and maintaining a positive reputation in the construction community.

Our owner, Juan Ponce, a simple man from humble beginnings, comes from a small town in Mexico where success is only a faint dream. In 1989, with his wife, kids and little money, Juan embarks on a risky journey that would relocate his family in Maryland. Full of determination, he began working labor intensive jobs, from washing dishes, to pouring concrete. After several years of persevering through the ups and downs of starting over, in 1996, Priority Construction Corporation was born. Juan envisioned a company based on building positive working relationships and maintaining a great reputation within the construction community.

Priority Construction Corp. was established in 1996 by Pedro Ponce, a humble man
from humble beginnings. Pedro Ponce envisioned a family owned company that focused
on building positive bonds and maintaining a good reputation within the construction
community in Baltimore. What started off as a small, family owned construction
company working on 1-2 projects at a time, has transformed into one of the most
successful minority based subcontractors in the Baltimore metropolitan area.

For the first couple of years, project bids where being made in the basement of his
family home in Silver Spring, MD, with a total work force of 10 people. As the years
passed by and more projects where being successfully completed, Priority
Construction Corp. started to build a reputation of not only finishing the projects
on time but with a professional craft that speaks for itself.

Baltimore Inner Harbor, Towson University, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Jones Falls
Trail, University of Maryland College Park, Metro Pointe in Wheaton, are just a few
projects that have been completed by the company and has the parts in Maryland with
a better view.

The driving force behind Priority Construction Corp. success has been and will
always be the individuals working for the company. Whether it's the Finisher
or Project Estimator, everyone's unique set of skills makes this company
always strive for success and their ability to solve any challenge they receive
makes Priority Construction Corp. an industry standard when it comes to the concrete
and brick paving business.
